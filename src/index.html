          <h2>My Frontend Engineer Journey</h2>
          <p>Starting my journey in 2020, at that time I joined the Workshop Riset Informatika community, starting with
            learning javascript and working on several side projects. Long story short, given the opportunity with
            seniors to create a project together using React.js, this was my first step in learning React Stacks, my
            seniors gave me the opportunity to explore new frontend stacks like TypeScript, React Hooks and Unit
            Testing.</p>
          <p>For each week, must present the results that have been learned to the team, then integrate them into the
            project. In 2021, I take an internship in a <span>startup company</span>. Not long after, I worked on
            several freelance
            projects with my lecturer at the Politeknik Negeri Malang. Now, very excited to continue my journey by
            improving my skills as a Frontend Engineer.</p>
